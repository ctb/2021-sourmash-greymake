# parallel search of sourmash databases with snakemake using manifests of manifests

(You'll need
[2021-sourmash-mom](https://github.com/ctb/2021-sourmash-mom) to run
the below.)

## Quickstart

### Create manifests for the signatures you want to search, based on the query

Run:
```
mkdir search
../2021-sourmash-mom/mom-select-to-picklists.py \
     wort-sra.zips/index.db --output-prefix=search/ -k 31 --dna
```
this will create a set of output files, `search/xar.sub.zip.csv` and
so on, that contain picklists with just the signatures you want to
search in each of the zip databases.

### Run the search

Then, run snakemake:
```
snakemake -j 4
```
This will search each individual database (potentially in parallel),
using the CSV files output by the previous command as picklists.

## TODO:

Integrate mom-select-to-picklists.py into the Snakefile better!
